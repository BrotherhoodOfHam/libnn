# Libnn

A simple Neural Network library implemented using CUDA. This project was developed for my final year project at university.

### Features:
* Dense layers
* Sigmoid, tanh, relu and softmax activation functions
* Dropout
* SGD and Adam optimizers
* Cross Entropy and Mean Squared Error loss functions

There are two sample programs:
* MNIST [classifier](samples/mnist_classifier.cpp)
* MNIST [GAN](samples/mnist_gan.cpp)
